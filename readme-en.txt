	1. Statement of Principles
	This organization does not exist to "carry others", "spoon-feed" or promote
	mediocrity among students of the Escuela Colombiana de Ingenier√≠a Julio Garavito.
	Instead, it seeks to create a space where ideas and creativity can coexist to solve
	workshops, labs, and projects collaboratively.

	2. Clear Purpose
	We want a place where ideas can come together toward a common goal: to learn,
	grow academically, and successfully pass our courses.

	3. Clarification
	We want to make it clear that this organization is not a platform for
	cheating or copying. It is meant as a source of inspiration, discussion,
	and a way to explore ideas to solve common problems.

	4. Commitment
	Each member of the organization commits to actively contributing by sharing
	their progress or projects, explaining not only what they did but also the
	reasoning behind their actions.

	5. Call to Action
	We invite all ECI students to join this organization, as long as they are willing
	to maintain a respectful attitude toward the ideas and approaches of others, and
	to build together a space of collaborative learning.
